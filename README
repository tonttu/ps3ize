fixes/{rename,fixclp}.rb do the same thing as a program called "AVCHDMe".
  For example SmartLabs tsMuxeR makes broken files that can't be played on
  PS3 without applying these hacks.

  rename.rb renames all files in a AVCHD directory to use 8.3 AVCHC
  filenames (required on PS3)

  fixclp.rb ensures that the clipinfo files (clipinf/*cpi) have a correct
  clip length in their headers (M2TS packet count)

convert/m2ts_to_ts.c converts M2TS/MTS files to TS files.

avchd/ is a AVCHD dir / Blu-ray authoring/muxing tool. Unusable at the moment.
